    It’s as simple as that. It was your first instinct from the second
    you were ejected out of your mother’s lady garden. So why then, do we
    sometimes find it so difficult to just relax, and breathe? Even before
    the 21st century Apocalyptic world that has now become our new norm
    reared its ugly head, the world in general was and is a stressful place
    to be. Always somewhere to be, or something to do. An unanswered email
    sitting in an inbox, or an annoying chore waiting on the end of a very
    long finger. A traffic jam, a medical issue, accruing debt, a
    conversation that needs to be had that nobody wants to have. All these
    little things sitting in the back of our minds, chirping away trying to
    talk over the other while vying for your attention.

    Sometimes there might not even feel like there’s a specific outside source causing your
    mental well-being to feel a bit off. It just is. You’re not alone. I get
    it. We get it. Life is hard, sometimes. Sure, we can utilize the
    standard crutches like hitting the bottle or popping some of “mommy’s
    special pills” from time to time. But there are alternate options to
    help ease our inner anguish.

    It’s far from a recent study that first
    discovered that physical activity and regular exercise could have a
    profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, and ADHD. It also
    relieves stress, improves memory, helps you sleep better (without the
    need for that nightcap), and just boosts your mood in general. The best
    part is you don’t even have to be a fitness freak to reap the benefits.
    Just getting out there and doing something is half the battle.

    Underwater happens to be the most unchallenging location to
    practice meditation for mental health. No distractions, no WiFi, no
    pinging cell phone notifications, no annoying leaf blowers, and
    construction workers who always seem to find that right outside your
    window to be the best place to work from, no nagging partner telling you
    to pick your 4-hour-old towel up off the floor. Just utter peace.

    Mindfulness is a big buzzword these days. Staying in the moment, and
    being present is an impressive skill to master. For an “extreme” sport,
    scuba diving is pretty good for your mental health. At the very least,
    nailing a solid breathing technique also does wonders for your buoyancy
    control. Float like a butterfly-fish, sting like a b(-fire) coral?
