# Deep Breath

Deep Breath is a site to advertise the scuba diving company "Deep Breath" and document the benefits of scuba diving on mental health. 

It will be useful for people interested in taking care of their well-being, and finding out more information on how to get started in partaking in underwater meditation.

The site can be accessed by this [link](https://kimatron.github.io/deepbreath/)

## Existing Features

- Contains the logo of the company on the left side.
- A full responsive navigation bar on the right includes links to the homepage of Deep Breath, a photo Gallery, a short blog on the benefits of scuba diving on mental health, and a Contact Us section. 
- Each section is easy to identify and identical in a manner to allow for easy navigation. 

The purpose of this feature is to allow users to easily navigate through different sections of the site.

### Footer
The footer remains at the bottom of the page and provides easy links to social media pages which are always easily accessible.

The landing page includes an image with text to grasp the user's attention and allows them to identify the section that they are interested in reading.

    - All text input fields are customized.
   - All inputs are set to be required to fill out.
    - The submit button is animated on hover.
     - The submit button leads to the response page.

## Design

### Color Scheme
Dark and light blues and coral shades were used to match the water theme of the company and to co-ordinate with underwater images and provide a contrast for visual ease.

### Typography

Main Font 
- Catamaran (sans-serif) Google Font was used as the main font of the website to increase the readability of the content on the pages.

Accent Font 
- Questrial (sans-serif) Google Font was used to attract viewers' attention to the company's logo, to differentiate the strong points of the company.


## Potential Future Features
In the future adding a feature to index local dive shops in a user's area via a mapping tool and linking them to dive shops in their locality would be beneficial rather than having to contact us and wait for a response.

 This could also be beneficial to *us* by way of commission of sales possibly.

 Adding a live booking feature would improve sales and increase response time.

Improving the quality of the commit messages will help debug and improve the quality and design of the site over time.
 
 
 ## Validator Testing
 On completion of the design, the site was tested across multiple browsers and platforms. The site has been built using Chrome, and so it was also tested across Microsoft Edge and Firefox for desktops and larger screen sizes, whilst tested using Safari and Chrome on mobile and tablet devices.

* Check validator websites for HTML and CSS and Accessibility when finished and save screenshots as proof here*
* use lighthouse
* accessibility is important (alt)

## Bugs
For some reason, I can't see the footer social media Icons in my preview, but they show in the deployed version. Spent too long trying to figure out why and wasted a lot of time on it.
