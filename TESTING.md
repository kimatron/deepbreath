# TESTING


## Compatibility

In order to confirm the correct functionality, responsiveness, and appearance:

+ The website was tested on the following browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari. All worked fine.

One strange bug I noticed in Incognito mode was that the Nav Menu was permanently set to the hover color, and did not change when they were hovered over. Outside incognito mode, this function worked fine.


## Responsiveness


+ The website was checked by devtools implemented in Firefox and Chrome browsers and ran through [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)

    - Main Page:

## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
    1. The Gallery section was very compressed and difficult to view the individual images in smaller screens.
    
        *Solutions:* Changed the grid template columns from 2fn to various pixel values for smaller screens.
    
    2. The footer social icons were not changing color on hover
        
        *Solution:* Deleted some unnecessary code above that was overriding the color change in my .social-icon code. 

    3. An inner scroll bar was causing issues with the footer, causing it to overlap over the side of the page. 
        
        *Solution:* Disabled scrolling in the main content code.

+ ### Unsolved bugs
    - Map was throwing an error in the validator, when I deleted the warning code, the map is now smaller than I originally planned for it's container.
+ ### Mistakes
- At one point I tried to turn on the backlight of my keyboard and hit F4 and my CodeAnywhere went crazy adding and deleting all sorts of code. I pushed the code not realizing what had happened and noticed that I had 12765 lines of code, from having about 600. Opened a new workplace from the previous push before and continued working from there.
    - Mistakes were made while committing changes. I was not using present tense or starting capital letters for my sentences. Some of my commits were a little messy, entering a lot of changes in different areas at once, but I got the hang of it towards the end.
